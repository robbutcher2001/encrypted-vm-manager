# Encrypted VM Manager

Manages the launching and terminating AWS VMs.

## Running the VM Manager

A convenience script has been written to:

- check you have the CLIs installed
- launch the VPN for encrypted comms
- launch the VM
- obtain the connection DNS hostname
- obtain the VM admin password
- terminate the VM once you're done

Exe can be run directly on MacOS by double-clicking `mManager`.

_Note: has not been tested outside of MacOS as audience is very small._

# Encrypted VM Manager

Use CloudFormation to manage launching and terminating VMs.

## Running the VM Manager

A convenience script has been written to:

- check you the CLIs installed
- launch the VPN for encrypted comms
- launch the VM
- obtain the connection DNS hostname
- obtain the VM admin password
- terminate the VM once you're done

Script can be run with `sh vmManager.sh` or double-clicked if you're default action for `.sh` files is to use Terminal / Command Prompt.
